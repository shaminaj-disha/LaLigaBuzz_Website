# LaLigaBuzz_Website

Wel come to LaLigaBuzz. It's a PHP based website.

To run LaLigaBuzz:

1. First we need to open Xampp and start mySql.

2. Then we have to copy 'sd' folder to 'C:\xampp\htdocs' directory and and copy our database 'laliga_db.sql'

3. Now from any browser we have to go 'localhost/sd/index.php' then our start page appears.

4. To maintain Project file size we have deleted our videos that were appeared previously in homepage ( as they were more than 1GB).

5. From dropdown menu we can choose team names and Team stats ( as shortage of time we just included two teams Barcelona and Real Madrid) .

6. We can also View player list ( Only Barcelona and Real Madrid players were included ) .

7. From player List we can see player details, player stats ( Lionel Messi from Barcelona , and Cristiano Ronaldo from Real Madrid )

8. To go to admin panel which was hidden from viewers we used "http://localhost/sd/wp-admin.php"

9. We can any username and password. then we will have our Insert Schedule form. In future we will add more admin panel.


More development is needed for this project.

Thank you.
